This utility takes two command line arguments

> ./triangle <MaxL> <MaxEll>

and outputs a table for

  L    = 0, ..., MaxL
  maxl = 0, ..., MaxEll
  
which will contain nontrivial block count in the final discretized Schr√∂dinger equation
as solved by hex-main. This number is useful for adjusting thread count when starting the
computation.
