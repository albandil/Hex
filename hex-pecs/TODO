This program is far from feature complete. Here are some notes on what should be added:

- Double check the formulas, so that we get exactly the same numbers as Philip Bartlett.
- Optimize the "matops" routines.
- Use real routines for real operations (not complex everywhere).
- Implement ScaLAPACK parallelization.
- Implement energy perturbation.
- Implement iterative coupling.
