                 HEX-CCC

------------
Dependencies
------------

The program is written in C++11 and can be successfully compiled on POSIX systems
by the following compilers:

 * GCC 4.8.1
 * Intel C++ Composer XE 14.0 SP1 Update 1 (tested with GCC 4.8.1 headers)
 
There are several external libraries that are being used for some partial tasks.
Here is the list of the libraries with versions that were used:

 * GSL 1.15
            Obtainable from
                http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
            Used for special functions and some others.

Some or all of the libraries may be present in precompiled form in the repositories
of the Linux distribution used.

-------------
Build and run
-------------

Once the needed libraries are present in the system include and library paths,
all that is necessary to build the program is running "make" from this directory.

> make

This should create an executable "hex-ccc" in the subdirectory "bin/".

If the external libraries are installed in non-standard locations, one needs to
edit the Makefile accordingly.

-------------------
Building on Windows
-------------------

The program has been successfully tested on Windows XP, 7 and 8. The compilation
has been done in the Code::Blocks IDE (the project file *.cbp is included with
the source code). It is necessary to install a full-featured MinGW compiler, though;
the compiler bundled with Code::Blocks lacks necessary features.

1) Download MinGW installer from SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download

2) Install C++ and Fortran compilers, OpenMP and Posix threads implementations.

3) Download and install latest Code::Blocks (tested version was 13.12).

4) In Code::Blocks IDE, set the full MinGW installation as the compiler to use.
