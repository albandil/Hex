                 HEX-CCC

------------
Dependencies
------------

The program is written in C++11 and can be successfully compiled by the
following compilers:

 * GCC 4.8.1
 * Intel C++ Composer XE 14.0 SP1 Update 1 (tested with GCC 4.8.1 headers)
 
There are several external libraries that are being used for some partial tasks.
Here is the list of the libraries with versions that were used:

 * GSL 1.15
            Obtainable from
                http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
            Used for special functions and some others.

Some or all of the libraries may be present in precompiled form in the repositories
of the Linux distribution used.

-------------
Build and run
-------------

Once the needed libraries are present in the system include and library paths,
all that is necessary to build the program is running "make" from this directory.

> make

This should create an executable "hex-ccc" in the subdirectory "bin/".

If the external libraries are installed in non-standard locations, one needs to
edit the Makefile accordingly.
