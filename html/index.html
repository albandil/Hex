		“<b>Hex</b>” stands for “<b>H</b>ydrogen-<b>e</b>lectron <b>c</b>ollision<b>s</b>”.
		This acronym actually covers several distinct things:
	</div>

	<ul>
		<li>
			low-energy scattering code implementing direct solution of Schrödinger equation
			using exterior complex scaling workaround for boundary condition, a.k.a.
			<a class = "module" href = "hex-main.html">hex-main</a>,
		</li>
		<li>
			high-energy scattering code implementing first and second order of
			distorted wave Born approximation, a.k.a. <a class = "module" href = "hex-dwba.html">hex-dwba</a>,
		</li>
		<li>
			the <a class = "module" href = "database.html">database</a> of T-matrices,
			as computed by these two modules, and
		</li>
		<li>
			the user interface (both CLI and Web), a.k.a. <a class = "module" href = "hex-db.html">hex-db</a>,
			which uses these data to compute derived scattering quantities.
		</li>
	</ul>
