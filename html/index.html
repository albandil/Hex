		“<b>Hex</b>” stands for “Hydrogen-electron collisions”.
		This acronym actually covers several distinct things:
	</div>

	<ul>
		<li>
			low-energy scattering code implementing direct solution of Schrödinger equation
			using exterior complex scaling workaround for boundary condition, a.k.a.
			<a href = "hex-ecs.html">hex-ecs</a>,
		</li>
		<li>
			intermediate-energy scattering code implementing first and second order of
			distorted wave Born approximation, a.k.a. <a href = "hex-dwba.html">hex-dwba</a>,
		</li>
		<li>
			high-energy scattering code implementing the first plane wave Born approximation,
			a.k.a. <a href = "hex-pwba.html">hex-pwba</a>,
		</li>
		<li>
			the <a href = "database.html">database</a> of T-matrices,
			as computed by these two modules, and
		</li>
		<li>
			the user interface (both CLI and Web), a.k.a. <a href = "hex-db.html">hex-db</a>,
			which uses these data to compute derived scattering quantities.
		</li>
	</ul>

        The source code of the programs can be downloaded at one's own risk (!),
        as the programs haven't been officially published yet, at
		the <a href = "http://sourceforge.net/projects/hecs/">SourceForge</a> page.
