                 HEX-PWBA

------------
Dependencies
------------

The program is written in C++11 and can be successfully compiled by the
following compilers:

 * GCC 4.7.2
 * Intel C++ Composer XE 14.0 SP1 Update 1 (tested with GCC 4.7.2 and 4.8.1 headers)
 
There are several external libraries that are being used for some partial tasks.
Some of them can be avoided if a correct compiler flag is added to CFLAGS in the
Makefile and the library link is removed from LIBRARY variable in Makefile.
Here is the list of the libraries with versions that were used:

 * GSL 1.15
            Needed, obtainable from
                http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
            Used for special functions and some others.

Some or all of the libraries may be present in precompiled form in the repositories
of the Linux distribution used.

-------------
Build and run
-------------

Once the needed libraries are present in the system include and library paths,
all that is necessary to build the program is running "make" from this directory.

> make

This should create an executable "hex-pwba" in the subdirectory "bin/". A simple
test run can be executed in the following way:

> mkdir test ; cd test                    # create a subdirectory for the test run
> ../bin/hex-pwba 1 0 1 0 0 4.            # run simple computation H(1s)->H(1s)

The last line of output will contain the following entries:
 1,2) initial state (ni=1, li=0)
 3,4) final state (nf=1, lf=0)
 5) partial wave angular momentum (L=0)
 6) impact energy (Ei=4 [Ry])

The output contains
 a) The impact energy Ei
 b) The angular momentum L
 b) The cross sections, which are given in the following order
    For mi = -li, ..., li
    {
      For mf = -lf, ..., lf
      {
        WRITE sigma(mi,mf)
      }
      WRITE Sum[mf] { sigma(mi,mf) }
    }
    WRITE Sum[mi,mf] { sigma(mi,mf) }
 
For the example run above, the output is the following set of numbers (apart from the SQL file):
4 0 1.642 1.642 1.642

If the libraries are installed in non-standard locations, one needs to edit the
Makefile accordingly.

-------------------
Building on Windows
-------------------

The program has been successfully tested on Windows XP, 7 and 8. The compilation
has been done in the Code::Blocks IDE (the project file *.cbp is included with
the source code). It is necessary to install a full-featured MinGW compiler, though;
the compiler bundled with Code::Blocks lacks necessary features.

1) Download MinGW installer from SourceForge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get-setup.exe/download

2) Install C++ and Fortran compilers, OpenMP and Posix threads implementations.

3) Download and install latest Code::Blocks (tested version was 13.12).

4) In Code::Blocks IDE, set the full MinGW installation as the compiler to use.
