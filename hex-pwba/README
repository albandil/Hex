                 HEX-DWBA

------------
Dependencies
------------

The program is written in C++11 and can be successfully compiled by the
following compilers:

 * GCC 4.7.2
 * Intel C++ Composer XE 14.0 SP1 Update 1 (tested with GCC 4.7.2 and 4.8.1 headers)
 
There are several external libraries that are being used for some partial tasks.
Some of them can be avoided if a correct compiler flag is added to CFLAGS in the
Makefile and the library link is removed from LIBRARY variable in Makefile.
Here is the list of the libraries with versions that were used:

 * GSL 1.15
            Needed, obtainable from
                http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
            Used for special functions and some others.

 * CLN 1.3.2
            Obtainable from
                http://www.ginac.de/CLN/
            Used for rational arithmetic to speed up analytically algorithmizable
            integration.

Some or all of the libraries may be present in precompiled form in the repositories
of the Linux distribution used.

-------------
Build and run
-------------

Once the needed libraries are present in the system include and library paths,
all that is necessary to build the program is running "make" from this directory.

> make

This should create an executable "hex-dwba" in the subdirectory "bin/". A simple
test run can be executed in the following way:

> mkdir test ; cd test                 # create a subdirectory for the test run
> ../bin/hex-pwba 1 0 1 0 4. 1e-5      # run simple computation H(1s)->H(1s) 4Ry

The last line of output will contain the following entries:
 1) impact energy (4 Ry)
 2) cross sections
 3) partial wave count

The cross sections are given in the following order

  For mi = -li, ..., li
  {
    For mf = -lf, ..., lf
    {
      WRITE sigma(mi,mf)
    }
    WRITE Sum[mf] { sigma(mi,mf) }
  }
  WRITE Sum[mi,mf] { sigma(mi,mf) }

In our case mi = mf = li = lf = 0, so there are three identical numbers.

If the libraries are installed in non-standard locations, one needs to edit the
Makefile accordingly.
