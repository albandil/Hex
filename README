Third-party libraries:
    GSL 1.16
    OpenBLAS 0.2.15
    UMFPACK 5.7.1           (part of SuiteSparse 4.4.4)
    sqlitepp 0.2            (included in libs/, works e.g. with sqlite3 3.15.0)
    CLN 1.3.4
    GiNaC 1.6.4

    SuperLU 5.0             (not recommended due to high memory requirements)
    MUMPS 5.0.2             (older versions seem to fail OOC mode)
