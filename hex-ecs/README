                 HEX-ECS

------------
Dependencies
------------

The program is written in C++11 and can be successfully compiled by the
following compilers:

 * GCC 5.2.0 (also MinGW-w64 based on this GCC)
 * LLVM/clang 3.7.1
 * Intel C++ Compiler 16.0.0
 
There are several external libraries that are being used for some partial tasks.
Some of them can be avoided if a correct compiler flag is added to CFLAGS in the
Makefile and the library link is removed from LIBRARY variable in Makefile.
Here is the list of the libraries with versions that were used:

 * OpenMPI 1.8.3 or Microsoft MPI v6
            Optional, can be eluded by -DNO_MPI.
            Used for distributed parallellization (hex-ecs --mpi).

 * UMFPACK 5.7.1
            Needed, obtainable as a part of SuiteSparse 4.4.3 from 
                http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/
            Used for solution of sparse linear systems.

 * OpenBLAS 0.2.15
            OpenBLAS is one of the best open-source implementations. Obtainable from
                http://www.openblas.net/

 * GSL 1.16
            Needed, obtainable from
                http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
            Used for special functions and some others.

Some or all of the libraries may be present in precompiled form in the repositories
of the Linux distribution used.

-------------
Build and run
-------------

Use Unix-like system (or Cygwin tools on Windows) for compilation.

Once the needed libraries are present in the system include and library paths,
all that is necessary to build the program is running "make" from this directory.

> make

This should create an executable "hex-ecs" in the subdirectory "bin/". A simple
test run can be executed in the following way:

> mkdir test ; cd test                 # create a subdirectory for the test run
> ../bin/hex-ecs --example             # generate a sample input file
> ../bin/hex-ecs --input example.inp   # use the input file

If the libraries are installed in non-standard locations, one needs to edit the
Makefile accordingly.

The HTML documentation can be extracted from the code by the program Doxygen:
