                 HEX-ECS

------------
Dependencies
------------

The program is written in C++11 and can be successfully compiled by the
following compilers:

 * GCC 4.7.2
 * Intel C++ 14.0 (tested with GCC 4.7.2 headers only)
 
There are several external libraries that are being used for some partial tasks.
Some of them can be avoided if a correct compiler flag is added to CFLAGS in the
Makefile and the library link is removed from LIBRARY variable in Makefile.
Here is the list of the libraries with versions that were used:

 * OpenMPI 1.6
            Optional, can be eluded by -DNO_MPI.
            Used for distributed parallellization (hex-ecs --mpi).

 * HDF 1.8.11
            Needed, obtainable from 
                http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html
            Used for intermediate output of results.

 * UMFPACK 5.6.1
            Needed, obtainable as a part of SuiteSparse from 
                http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/
            Used for solution of sparse linear systems.

 * OpenBLAS 0.2.8
            Optional, but some BLAS implementation is necessary for SuiteSparse
            for dense matrix kernels. OpenBLAS is one of the best open-source
            implementations. Obtainable from
                http://www.openblas.net/
            Not directly used by hex-ecs.

 * GSL 1.15
            Needed, obtainable from
                http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
            Used for special functions and some others.

 * FFTW 3.3.3
            Needed, obtainable from
                http://www.fftw.org/download.html
            Used for Chebyshev expansion and Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

 * OpenCL 1.2
            Optional, obtainable from CPU/GPU manufacturer web pages or from
            other vendors. Used for [preliminary] GPU support (preconditioner
            "gpuJacobi").


-------------
Build and run
-------------

Once the needed libraries are present in the system include and library paths,
all that is necessary to build the program is running "make" from this directory.

> make

This should create an executable "hex-ecs" in the subdirectory "bin/". A simple
test run can be executed in the following way:

> mkdir test ; cd test                 # create a subdirectory for the test run
> ../bin/hex-ecs --example             # generate a sample input file
> ../bin/hex-ecs --input example.inp   # use the input file

If the libraries are installed in non-standard locations, one needs to edit the
Makefile accordingly.
