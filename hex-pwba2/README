Dependencies
------------

The program is written in C++11 and can be successfully compiled by the
following compilers:

 * GCC 4.8.1
 * Intel C++ Composer XE 14.0 SP1 Update 1 (tested with GCC 4.8.1 headers)
 
There are several external libraries that are being used for some partial tasks.
Some of them can be avoided if a correct compiler flag is added to CFLAGS in the
Makefile and the library link is removed from LIBRARY variable in Makefile.
Here is the list of the libraries with versions that were used:

 * GSL 1.15
            Needed, obtainable from
                http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
            Used for special functions and some others.
            
 * FFTW 3.3.3
            Needed, obtainable from
                http://www.fftw.org/download.html
            Used for Chebyshev expansion and Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

Some or all of the libraries may be present in precompiled form in the repositories
of the Linux distribution used.
